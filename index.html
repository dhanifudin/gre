city of Transopolis.</p><blockquote><p>"Ten years ago, as part of a comprehensive urban renewal program, the city of
Transopolis adapted for industrial use a large area of severely substandard
housing near the freeway. Subsequently, several factories were constructed
there, crime rates in the area declined, and property tax revenues for the
entire city increased. To further revitalize the city, we should now take
similar action in a declining residential area on the opposite side of the
city. Since some houses and apartments in existing nearby neighborhoods are
currently unoccupied, alternate housing for those displaced by this action
will be readily available."</p></blockquote><p>Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to
evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen
the argument.</p></div></div><div class="swiper-slide section-title" data-hash="slide-3" role="group" aria-label="3 / 7" style="width: 1184px;"><div class="slide-internal-box"><h2>Answer</h2><blockquote><p>The author needs evidence that relocation to industrial area can led to several
advantages over the past decade. Among the advantages are: reduced crime rates
and increased property tax revenue. The decline in crime rates may be due to
actions taken by the police to suppress crime. In addition, it can also be
caused by the high level of public legal awareness.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The author has mentioned the increase in the property tax for the entire city.
This statement is baseless, because the author can't assume that the increase in
property tax was due to the contribution of taxes from factory area. The
increase in taxes could be due to other sources of income such tourism,
restaurants, hotels or other business.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Even if success is due to the use of industrial area, the author needs to
provide evidence that the same plan will work on the other area of city.
It is possible that the success of the first industrialization was due to the
absence of a major industrial section in the city. The secondary areas may not
see the same trend. Even if industry comes, they are prone to make pollution.
The establishment of industry in the new area may cause a lot of complaints and
protests to the government.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In conclusion, the author fails to make his recommendation acceptable. The
argument lacks the several vital evidence. The author needs to present more
relevant evidence to support of his argument and must present some new
measures compared to the plan adopted ten years ago.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="swiper-slide section-title" data-hash="slide-4" role="group" aria-label="4 / 7" style="width: 1184px;"><div class="slide-internal-box"><h2>Thank You</h2></div></div><div class="swiper-slide title" data-hash="slide-5" role="group" aria-label="5 / 7" style="width: 1184px;"><div class="slide-internal-box"><h1>GRE</h1><h2>Graduate Record Examination</h2><div class="grid"><p>Presenter:</p><a href="https://github.com/dhanifudin" class="account account-github" aria-label="account-github"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 496 512" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M165.9 397.4c0 2-2.3 3.6-5.2 3.6-3.3.3-5.6-1.3-5.6-3.6 0-2 2.3-3.6 5.2-3.6 3-.3 5.6 1.3 5.6 3.6zm-31.1-4.5c-.7 2 1.3 4.3 4.3 4.9 2.6 1 5.6 0 6.2-2s-1.3-4.3-4.3-5.2c-2.6-.7-5.5.3-6.2 2.3zm44.2-1.7c-2.9.7-4.9 2.6-4.6 4.9.3 2 2.9 3.3 5.9 2.6 2.9-.7 4.9-2.6 4.6-4.6-.3-1.9-3-3.2-5.9-2.9zM244.8 8C106.1 8 0 113.3 0 252c0 110.9 69.8 205.8 169.5 239.2 12.8 2.3 17.3-5.6 17.3-12.1 0-6.2-.3-40.4-.3-61.4 0 0-70 15-84.7-29.8 0 0-11.4-29.1-27.8-36.6 0 0-22.9-15.7 1.6-15.4 0 0 24.9 2 38.6 25.8 21.9 38.6 58.6 27.5 72.9 20.9 2.3-16 8.8-27.1 16-33.7-55.9-6.2-112.3-14.3-112.3-110.5 0-27.5 7.6-41.3 23.6-58.9-2.6-6.5-11.1-33.3 2.6-67.9 20.9-6.5 69 27 69 27 20-5.6 41.5-8.5 62.8-8.5s42.8 2.9 62.8 8.5c0 0 48.1-33.6 69-27 13.7 34.7 5.2 61.4 2.6 67.9 16 17.7 25.8 31.5 25.8 58.9 0 96.5-58.9 104.2-114.8 110.5 9.2 7.9 17 22.9 17 46.4 0 33.7-.3 75.4-.3 83.6 0 6.5 4.6 14.4 17.3 12.1C428.2 457.8 496 362.9 496 252 496 113.3 383.5 8 244.8 8zM97.2 352.9c-1.3 1-1 3.3.7 5.2 1.6 1.6 3.9 2.3 5.2 1 1.3-1 1-3.3-.7-5.2-1.6-1.6-3.9-2.3-5.2-1zm-10.8-8.1c-.7 1.3.3 2.9 2.3 3.9 1.6 1 3.6.7 4.3-.7.7-1.3-.3-2.9-2.3-3.9-2-.6-3.6-.3-4.3.7zm32.4 35.6c-1.6 1.3-1 4.3 1.3 6.2 2.3 2.3 5.2 2.6 6.5 1 1.3-1.3.7-4.3-1.3-6.2-2.2-2.3-5.2-2.6-6.5-1zm-11.4-14.7c-1.6 1-1.6 3.6 0 5.9 1.6 2.3 4.3 3.3 5.6 2.3 1.6-1.3 1.6-3.9 0-6.2-1.4-2.3-4-3.3-5.6-2z"></path></svg></a><p>Dian Hanifudin Subhi</p></div></div></div><div class="swiper-slide section-title" data-hash="slide-6" role="group" aria-label="6 / 7" style="width: 1184px;"><div class="slide-internal-box"><h1>Passage</h1><p>The following appeared in a letter from the owner of the Sunnyside Towers
apartment complex to its manager.</p><blockquote><p>"One month ago, all the showerheads in the first three buildings of the
Sunnyside Towers complex were modified to restrict maximum water flow to
one-third of what it used to be. Although actual readings of water usage before
and after the adjustment are not yet available, the change will obviously result
in a considerable savings for Sunnyside Corporation, since the corporation must
pay for water each month. Except for a few complaints about low water pressure,
no problems with showers have been reported since the adjustment. I predict that
modifying showerheads to restrict water flow throughout all twelve buildings in
the Sunnyside Towers complex will increase our profits even more dramatically."</p></blockquote><p>Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered

are reasonable. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help
