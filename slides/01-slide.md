## Passage

The following appeared in a recommendation from the planning department of the
city of Transopolis.

> "Ten years ago, as part of a comprehensive urban renewal program, the city of
> Transopolis adapted for industrial use a large area of severely substandard
> housing near the freeway. Subsequently, several factories were constructed
> there, crime rates in the area declined, and property tax revenues for the
> entire city increased. To further revitalize the city, we should now take
> similar action in a declining residential area on the opposite side of the
> city. Since some houses and apartments in existing nearby neighborhoods are
> currently unoccupied, alternate housing for those displaced by this action
> will be readily available."

Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to
evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen
the argument.

## Answer

> The author needs evidence that relocation to industrial area can led to several
> advantages over the past decade. Among the advantages are: reduced crime rates
> and increased property tax revenue. The decline in crime rates may be due to
> actions taken by the police to suppress crime. In addition, it can also be
> caused by the high level of public legal awareness.

> The author has mentioned the increase in the property tax for the entire city.
> This statement is baseless, because the author can't assume that the increase in
> property tax was due to the contribution of taxes from factory area. The
> increase in taxes could be due to other sources of income such tourism,
> restaurants, hotels or other business.

> Even if success is due to the use of industrial area, the author needs to
> provide evidence that the same plan will work on the other area of city.
> It is possible that the success of the first industrialization was due to the
> absence of a major industrial section in the city. The secondary areas may not
> see the same trend. Even if industry comes, they are prone to make pollution.
> The establishment of industry in the new area may cause a lot of complaints and
> protests to the government.

> In conclusion, the author fails to make his recommendation acceptable. The
> argument lacks the several vital evidence. The author needs to present more
> relevant evidence to support of his argument and must present some new
> measures compared to the plan adopted ten years ago.
