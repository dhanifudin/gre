## Passage

The following appeared in a letter from the owner of the Sunnyside Towers
apartment complex to its manager.

> "One month ago, all the showerheads in the first three buildings of the
> Sunnyside Towers complex were modified to restrict maximum water flow to
> one-third of what it used to be. Although actual readings of water usage
> before and after the adjustment are not yet available, the change will
> obviously result in a considerable savings for Sunnyside Corporation, since
> the corporation must pay for water each month. Except for a few complaints
> about low water pressure, no problems with showers have been reported since
> the adjustment. I predict that modifying showerheads to restrict water flow
> throughout all twelve buildings in the Sunnyside Towers complex will increase
> our profits even more dramatically."

Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered
in order to decide whether the prediction and the argument on which it is based
are reasonable. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help
to evaluate the prediction.

## Answer

The author insists that Sunnyside Corporation should change their showerheads
that can restrict maximum water flow throughout all twelve buildings. The author
argues the change will increase profits without any serious problem due to the
cost saving. However, in my perspective the argument is flawed and needs to
provide more evidence to strengthen the claim.

The author needs to provide evidence to support the claim that the change will
bring no problems. According to the reading, there are a few complaints about
low water pressure. However, it's possible that the problem will arrise because
complaints collected are only for a month. The author can't make a prediction
before the exact number of complaints collected.

Moreover, there are possible differences between the condition of all buildings.
The remaining nine buildings may be at high altitude and the changes may result
in increased complaints about low pressure. In addition, there are no data about
water usage for all buildings. Water usage at the same time can cause water low
pressure.

In conclusion, the author gives the unwarranted claim that Sunnyside Corporation
should expand the modification of showerheads to all buildings. To strengthen
argument, the author should provide evidence and gather more data regarding
water pressure factor.
