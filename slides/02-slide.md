# Passage

The following appeared in a letter from the owner of the Sunnyside Towers
apartment complex to its manager.

> "One month ago, all the showerheads in the first three buildings of the
> Sunnyside Towers complex were modified to restrict maximum water flow to
> one-third of what it used to be. Although actual readings of water usage before
> and after the adjustment are not yet available, the change will obviously result
> in a considerable savings for Sunnyside Corporation, since the corporation must
> pay for water each month. Except for a few complaints about low water pressure,
> no problems with showers have been reported since the adjustment. I predict that
> modifying showerheads to restrict water flow throughout all twelve buildings in
> the Sunnyside Towers complex will increase our profits even more dramatically."

Write a response in which you discuss what questions would need to be answered
in order to decide whether the prediction and the argument on which it is based
are reasonable. Be sure to explain how the answers to these questions would help
to evaluate the prediction.
